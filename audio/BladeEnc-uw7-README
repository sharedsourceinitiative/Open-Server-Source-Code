BladeEnc is a program to generate MP3 files from WAV 
or AIFF sound files. It produces very good quality 
output and is probably the fastest free encoder
around (especially at higher bit-rates.)

The source code is not available at the moment, but
Tord Jansson, the author, is preparing to release
a GPL version in the near future.

The Skunkware distribution of BladeEnc 0.76 consists
of:

BladeEnc076-SCO-UW7.pkg.gz
README-UW7 (this file)

After having gunzip'd the pkg install it by executing
(as root):

#pkgadd -d <full-pathname-of-package>

Once installed see the man page 'bladeenc' for details
on use.

My thanks to Tord Jansson for giving permission to 
include BladeEnc in Skunkware.

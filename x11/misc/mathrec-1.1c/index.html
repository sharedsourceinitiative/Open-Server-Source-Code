The mathrec package consists of several X11 clients :

<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the mathrec binaries, use the Imakefile. 
To build with the Imakefile, first type
"xmkmf -a" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system 
doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the mathrec binaries will be
built. 

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install mathrec, you can simply run "make install; make install.man".
Since mathrec is built with imake, it honors the DESTDIR setting. So, if
you want to install the mathrec package in a "packaging ground", you can
set the DESTDIR environment variable to the location below which the files
will be installed.

<DT><B>Known Limitations</B>
<DD>These programs were originally written for 8-bit PseudoColor X11 displays.
I have modified them so that they work on a TrueColor visual but many of
the features are not present without a PseudoColor display. For instance,
the installation of a private colormap and the spinning of the color map
are features available only on a PseudoColor display visual.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>These programs and others like them are probably responsible for more
CPU cycles than any other single application.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I have used these for years without harm.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None

<DT><B>Documentation</B>
<DD>manual pages.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Execute any or all of the shell scripts provided in
/usr/local/mathrec/julia, /usr/local/mathrec/mandel, /usr/local/mathrec/lds,
/usr/local/mathrec/endo,
/usr/local/mathrec/lyap,
/usr/local/mathrec/madness and
/usr/local/mathrec/splines.

<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>Lds is an X11 client.
<P>
The lds program generates and displays a sequence of curves or 
cellular automata like figures which graphically represent the 
evolution of a Lattice Dynamical System (LDS). An LDS is an array
of cells, each of which represents a dynamical system. Each cell
is coupled to its nearest neighbors. The dynamical systems available
in this software package are currently the logistic map, circle map
and tent map. The state of each cell in the LDS is a real number in
the unit interval. The evolution of the lattice is determined by an
iteration thru the specified dynamic (e.g. the logistic equation)
followed by a weighted averaging with its nearest neighbors.
<P>
Command line arguments and run-time keyboard input allow lds to simulate
a wide variety of lattice dynamical systems. The user can specify the
dynamic to be used, the non-linearity parameter, the strength of coupling,
the initial conditions, the size of the array, the length of the run,
whether and how to evolve connection strengths, and more. During the run,
the display of the evolving LDS can either be CA-like with each generation
being represented as a horizontal line evolving upward in the window or as
points or a curve with X axis the lattice and Y-axis the cell states [0,1].
In addition, graphical display of cell states can be toggled between actual
state and phase difference with left neighbor. A site histogram curve can 
also be displayed.
<P>
Lattice dynamical systems are also referred to as coupled map lattices.

<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the lds binary, either use the Imakefile or the 
sample makefile - Makefile.std. To build with the Imakefile, first type
"xmkmf" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system 
doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the lds binary will be built.
<P>
The manual pages can be formatted by typing "nroff -man lds.man > lds.doc" 

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install lds, copy the lds binary to the desired location (the sample
makefiles put it in /usr/local/bin)
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/local/man/cat1 for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>This program can be used to explore the largely unmapped terrain
of the evolution of coupled map lattices. In that sense, it may assist
in the construction of a phenomenology of such maps.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I have used this for years without harm.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>

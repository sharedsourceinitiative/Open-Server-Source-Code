<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
The idea here is to calculate and display aggregating particles.
In order to accomplish this, a modified random walk algorithm is used.
Initial particles are "seeded" at the "bottom" or the "sea". Particles
are then "dropped" randomly from above. When a particle comes within a
pixel of an already existent particle, it "sticks". After N particles 
have "stuck", the color is incremented. Thus, color indicates "age".
<DT><B>Acknowledgements</B>
<DD>
The algorithm was derived from lectures given by Dietmar Saupe at the 
University of California at Santa Cruz. Assistance with colormaps and 
spinning color wheels and X was gleaned from Hiram Clawson and Stacey Campbell.
<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the coral binary, either use the Imakefile or the sample makefile,
Makefile.std. If your system doesn't support prototypes, uncomment the 
PROTODEFINE line of the Imakefile.
<P>
After modifying the Imakefile appropriately, either use "xmkmf" or "imake"
to create a Makefile. Then just type "make" to compile coral.
<P>
The manual page can be formatted by typing "nroff -man coral.man > coral.6X".
<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install coral, copy the coral binary to the desired location (the sample
makefile puts it in /usr/games/X11)
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/games/X11/doc for games and imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.

You can test coral by just invoking it with no arguments. It should display
a 512x480 image. Some workstations may be slow to calculate and display the
coral growth as there are many calculations involved.
<P>
Some "interesting" ways to run coral are as follows :
<BR>
% coral -F -n 10 -d
<BR>
(use the full screen, calculate 10 maps in demo mode)
<BR>
% coral -R
<BR>
(display on the root window)
<BR>
% coral -o coralgrowth.ppm
<BR>
(calculate and display with default parameters and save the resulting image
 as a PPM file called coralgrowth.ppm. this can be viewed later using xv or 
 any PPM viewing utility)

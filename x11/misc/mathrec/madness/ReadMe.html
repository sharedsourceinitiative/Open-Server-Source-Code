<DT><B>History</B>
<DD>
Written 4/22 1988 by Ron Record (rr@sco.com).
Based in part on the Computer Recreations article in the 5/88
Scientific American.
<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
The heart drawing mode was added right after the Loma Prieta
earthquake. The idea was to convey the sense of a seismograph
gone berserk but forming the shape of a heart.
<P>
Some sample shell scripts are provided in /usr/local/mathrec/madness.
<P>
It's amazing what you can do with sines and cosines.
<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the madness binary, use the Imakefile.
After modifying the Imakefile appropriately, either use "xmkmf" or "imake"
to create a Makefile. Then just type "make" to compile madness.
<P>
The manual page can be formatted by typing 
"nroff -man madness.man > madness.1".

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install madness, copy the madness binary to the desired location (the sample
makefile puts it in /usr/local/bin). Also copy the resource file Madness.ad
to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Madness or append it to you local $HOME/.Xdefaults.
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/man/cat.LOCAL for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.

SVR4 Library Rules and Template
===============================

I've included the sv4Lib.rules and sv4Lib.tmpl files here
because i used them to build the shared libXpm for SCO OpenServer
available at ../../../osr5/lib/xpm-3.4j

To see how these files can be used in an Imakefile, see the Imakefiles
in ../../x11/xpm-3.4j and ../../x11/xpm-3.4j/lib (after extracting the
compressed archive of the Xpm 3.4j source).

In order to instruct imake how to find the additional config files,
use a command like :
    $ imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config -I/.../config
replacing the "..." with the path to these SVR4 library rules.

If necessary, you can then run "make Makefiles" etc.

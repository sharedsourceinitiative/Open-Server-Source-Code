CD-Record-1.6.1
---------------

You can set the device name directly to be something like "/dev/rcd2" or just
give the number of the /dev/rcd device to be attached to the predefined string
/dev/rcd.

[NOTE: You need to be root user to use cdrecord!]

Method 1:
---------


[make sure you use a ":" between the device name instead of the "," as with
method 2!]

#cdrecord dev=/dev/rcd0:5,0 ...

means use the special node "/dev/rcd0" and target 5, lun 0 as the cdrecorder.

Setting CDR_DEVICE=/dev/rcd0:5,0 does the same.


Method 2:
---------

#cdrecord dev=1,4,0 ...

means use the special node "/dev/rcd1" and target 4, lun 0 as the cdrecorder.

Setting CDR_DEVICE=1,4,0 does the same.

Some restrictions apply to this OpenServer 5 port:
--------------------------------------------------

It does not use FIFO ring buffering, so according to the original author, you
will not be able to record "on-the-fly" from a NFS mount, but anything with an
image already cut or from a local disc will work up to 8 speed recording, which
I can't test with my 4speed TEAC.

Specifying the target, lun does have no real effect, as the Srom driver does
not make use of it, just specify it for the rigth output and that cdrecord does
not complain about hte missing target and lun!

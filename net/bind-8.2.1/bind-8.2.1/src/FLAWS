2. need a way to export the h_errno from hidden resolver contexts through
   the irs interface.  given that h_errno is a bad idea and that having it
   in the resolver rather than in netdb is a really bad idea, what can we
   actually do?  (note that all of irs needs at most one resolver context,
   but there's nowhere to hang it in the current pvt structures.)

1. need to inherit resolver options from global context if they are not
   set in the ninit function somehow.  need to think about the effects
   of the various environment variables if they fail to mention something
   which was also inherited.  need a sticky bit per option?

Installing TightVNC on OpenServer 5


TightVNC needs bash, perl and Glib. It expects bash
and perl in /usr/local/bin, so if they are in /usr/bin, do a

# ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl
# ln -s /usr/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash

It seems to expect some files in a different directory. Check if
"/usr/X11R6" exists. If not,
ln -s /usr /usr/X11R6
There should now be the directory "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts".

If perl and bash are not installed, download and install
from skunkware (or from the CD that came with the system).

Download Glib from skunkware. I installed Glib-1.5 from the
Glib-1.5-VOLS.tar file.
tar xvf Glib-1.5-VOLS.tar to extract the VOL.* files.
Use 'scoadmin software' or the GUI to install from Media Images.

Install tightvnc from the tightvnc-1.2.2-VOLS.tar file.
tar xvf tigntvnc-1.2.2-VOLS.tar to extract the VOL.* files.
Use 'scoadmin software' or the GUI to install from Media Images.


Using tightvnc.

As the user, type "vncpasswd" and give a password that will be needed
to connect to the Virtual Computer screen. NOTE: vncserver asks for the
password, but it did not work correctly for me.

'vncserver' starts VNC. You should see 'Xvnc' running. Note the display
number. You will connect to the VNC window in the browser with
"http://:580N/ <http://:580n/>" where N
is the number returned from vncserver.

To end the session, each user connected to the display should use the
'disconnect' option. Then, as the user that started vncserver, type
"vncserver -kill :N" where N is the display number.

Information is in the .vnc directory in $HOME of the user who runs
vncserver.

</CENTER>

<P>  These packages include binaries (SCO OpenServer and SCO Unixware) and 
original source and documentation for <STRONG>expect</STRONG>, a program that 
enables programmed dialogue with other interactive programs (like ftp 
and telnet).
</P>

<P>  This version is Expect-5.22 for Tcl 7.5 and 7.6, Tk 4.1, 4.2 released

The beta Tcl (and Tk) versions are not supported with this version
</P>

<P>  Expect uses 
<A HREF="./tcl7.6.html">Tcl</A>
as the underlying language for expressing things such
as procedures, loops, file I/O, and arithmetic expressions.  
An interactive debugger (for tcl) is bundled with Expect.  
</P>
        
<P>  Expect may also be built using the Tk library, a Tcl interface to the
X Window System and It is possible to embed the Expect/Tcl core 
and optionally Tk in your own C programs.  This is described in libexpect(3).
</P>

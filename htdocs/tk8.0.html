Tk8.0 (Skunkware98)
</H1>
</CENTER>

These packages are binary runtimes (for SCO OpenServer) and
the sources and documentation for <STRONG>Tk</STRONG>
, an X11 toolkit implemented with 
the 
<A HREF="./tcl8.0.html">Tcl</A>
scripting language.  
The information here corresponds to Tk 8.0p2, the second (and probably last)
patch release of Tk 8.0 released June 30 1997.
This release is designed to work with Tcl 8.0p2
and may not work with any other version of Tcl.

<P>  Tk 8.0 is a major release with significant new features such as native
look and feel on Macintoshes and PCs, a new font mechanism, application
embedding, and proper support for Safe-Tcl.
There should be no backward incompatibilities in Tk 8.0 that affect
scripts.
</P>

<P>  Note: with this release the Tk version number skips from 4.2 to 8.0.
The jump was made in order to synchronize the Tcl and Tk version
numbers.
</P>

<H2>INSTALL WARNING</H2>

<P>      If the binary packages for this are installed <STRONG>after</STRONG>
     any packages for   Tk4.2, This installation will overwrite 
    <UL>
    <LI>   The man pages
    <LI>   The Header files
    </UL>
    for Tk4.2. This shouldn't be a great problem for documentation 
    (8.00 is upwards compatible)  but may be a 
    an issue if you need the 4.2 header files for building extensions.
</P>

<P>      To avoid these problems if you have tk4.2 installed,
    you should copy the tcl header files and man pages 
    for Tk4.2 to somehere other than the default 
    /usr/local{include, man} locations  before installing Tk8.0
</P>

<H2>Summary of changes from tk4.2 </H2>

<P>  Here is a list of the most important new features in Tk 8.0.  The
release also includes several smaller feature changes and bug fixes. 
See the "changes" file for a complete list of all changes.
</P>
<OL>
    <LI>  Native look and feel.  The widgets have been rewritten to provide
    (nearly?) native look and feel on the Macintosh and PC.  Many
    widgets, including scrollbars, menus, and the button family, are
    implemented with native platform widgets.  Others, such as entries
    and texts, have been modified to emulate native look and feel. 
    These changes are backwards compatible except that (a) some
    configuration options are now ignored on some platforms and (b) you
    must use the new menu mechanism described below to native look and
    feel for menus.

    <LI>  There is a new interface for creating menus, where a menubar is
    implemented as a menu widget instead of a frame containing menubuttons.
    The -menu option for a toplevel is used to specify the name of the
    menubar; the menu will be displayed *outside* the toplevel using
    different mechanisms on each platform (e.g. on the Macintosh the menu
    will appear at the top of the screen).  See the menu demos in the
    widget demo for examples.  The old style of menu still works, but
    does not provide native look and feel.  Menus have several new
    features:
    <UL>

        <LI> New "-columnbreak" and "-hideMargin" options make it possible
	  to create multi-column menus.
	<LI>  It is now possible to manipulate the Apple and Help menus on
	  the Macintosh, and the system menu on Windows.  It is also
	  possible to have a right justified Help menu on Unix.
	<LI>  Menus now issue the virtual event <<MenuSelect>> whenever the
	  current item changes.  Applications can use this to generate
	  help messages.
        <LI> There is a new "-direction" option for menubuttons, which
	  controls where the menu pops up revenues to the button.
    </UL>

    <LI> The font mechanism in Tk has been completely reworked:
        <UL>
	<LI> Font names need not be nasty X LFDs: more intuitive names
	  like {Times 12 Bold} can also be used.  See the manual entry
	  font.n for details.
	<LI>  Font requests always succeed now.  If the requested font is
	  not available, Tk finds the closest available font and uses
	  that one.
	<LI>  Tk now supports named fonts whose precise attributes can be
	  changed dynamically.  If a named font is changed, any widget
	  using that font updates itself to reflect the change.
	<LI> There is a new command "font" for creating named fonts and
	  querying various information about fonts.
	<LI>  There are now officially supported C APIs for measuring and
	  displaying text.  If you use these APIs now, your code will
	  automatically handle international text when internationalization
	  is added to Tk in a future release.  See the manual entries
	  MeasureChar.3, TextLayout.3, and FontId.3.
	<LI> The old C procedures Tk_GetFontStruct, Tk_NameOfFontStruct,
	  and Tk_FreeFontStruct have been replaced with more portable
	  procedures Tk_GetFont, Tk_NameOfFont, and Tk_FreeFont.
    </UL>
    
    <LI> Application embedding.  It is now possible to embedded one Tcl/Tk
    application inside another, using the -container option on frame
    widgets and the -use option for toplevel widgets or on the command
    line for wish.  Embedding should be fully functional under Unix,
    but the implementation is incomplete on the Macintosh and PC.

    <LI> Tk now works correctly with Safe-Tcl: it can be loaded into
    safe interpreters.

    <LI> Text widgets now allow images to be embedded directly in the
    text without using embedded windows.  This is more efficient and
    provides smoother scrolling.

    <LI> Buttons have a new -default option for drawing default rings in
    a platform-specific manner.

    <LI> There is a new "gray75" bitmap, and the "gray25" bitmap is now
    really 25% on (due to an ancient mistake, it had been only 12% on).
    The Macintosh now supports native bitmaps, including new builtin
    bitmaps "stop", "caution", and "note", plus the ability to use
    bitmaps in the application's resource fork.

    <LI> The "destroy" command now ignores windows that don't exist
    instead of generating an error.
</OL>

Tk 8.0 introduces the following incompatibilities that may affect Tcl/Tk
scripts that worked under Tk 4.2 and earlier releases:

<OL>
    <LI> Font specifications such as "Times 12" now interpret the size
    as points, whereas it used to be pixels (this was actually a bug,
    since the behavior was documented as points).  To get pixels now,
    use a negative size such as "Times -12".

    <LI> The -transient option for menus is no longer supported.  You can
    achieve the same effect with the -type field.

    <LI> In the canvas "coords" command, polygons now return only the
    points that were explicitly specified when the polygon was created
    (they used to return an extra point if the polygon wasn't originally
    closed).  Internally, polygons are still closed automatically for
    purposes of display and hit detection; the extra point just isn't
    returned by the "coords" command.

    <LI> The photo image mechanism now uses Tcl_Channels instead of FILEs,
   in order to make it portable.  FILEs are no longer used anywhere
   in Tk.

    <LI> The procedures Tk_GetFontStruct, Tk_NameOfFontStruct,
    and Tk_FreeFontStruct have been removed.
</OL>

<P>  Note: the new compiler in Tcl 8.0 may also affect Tcl/Tk scripts; check
the Tcl documentation for information on incompatibilities introduced by
Tcl 8.0.

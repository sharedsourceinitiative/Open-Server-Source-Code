</H1>
</CENTER>


<P>   Tcl (TclX) 8.0.2, is a set of extensions to Tcl 8.0p2, the Tool Command
Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout.  
<A HREF="./tcl8.0.html">Tcl</A>
is a powerful, yet simple extendable,  embeddable programming language.  
Extended Tcl is oriented towards Unix system
programming tasks and large application development providing 
interfaces to the Unix systemcalls  and libraries and  many additional
Tcl programming constructs and debugging tools.
</P>
<P>      This version is TclX8.0 patch 2 corresponding to Tcl8.0p2 and Tk8.0p2
The packages supplied include binary runtimes for 
SCO OpenServer and the source and doc package
and includes both tcl (the tclX interpreter
extending tcl) and wishx ( the tclX interpreter extending wish (the
Tcl/Tk interpreter))
</P>

<P>  TclX provides the following added capability to Tcl
    (see the manual page man/TclX.man)
</P>

    <LI> Keyed lists, a type of list that provides functionality
      similar to C structures.

    <LI> A command tracing facility for debugging and a performance profiler.

      including process management.

    <LI> File control and status commands provide added facilities for accessing
      and manipulating open files.

    <LI> X/PG based internationalization commands.

    <LI> Support for event-oriented programming in non-Tk applications.

      large applications.  It is compatible with standard Tcl auto-loading.

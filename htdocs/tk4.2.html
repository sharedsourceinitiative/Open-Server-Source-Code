Tk4.2 (Skunkware97)
</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
These packages are binary runtimes (for SCO UnixWare and OpenServer)
and the sources and documentation for <STRONG>Tk</STRONG>,
an X11 toolkit implemented 
with the 
<A HREF="./tcl7.6.html">Tcl</A> 
scripting language 
</P>
<P>The information here corresponds to Tk 4.2, patch level 2 for Tk 4.2,
released January 31, 1997.   This
is actually the first official patch release for Tk 4.2: patch level 1
was only released for the Macintosh.  Tk 4.2 is designed to work with
Tcl 7.6 and may not work with any other version of Tcl.
</P>


<H2>Summary of changes in Tk 4.2 </H2>

<P>  Tk 4.2 is a minor release.  The main changes are a revision of the
gridder, a new set of standard dialog boxes, and a new virtual event
mechanism.  See below for details.  There should be no backward
incompatibilities in Tk 4.2 except for two small changes related to the
gridder.  
</P>

<P>  Here are the new features in Tk 4.2.  The release also includes several
bug fixes.  See the "changes" file in the source package 
for a complete list of all changes.
</P>
<OL>

    <LI>  The grid geometry manager has been completely rewritten:
        <UL>
        <LI>  The layout algorithm produces much better layouts than before,
          particularly where rows or columns were stretchable.
        <LI> There is a new -pad option for rows and columns.
        <LI> The command "grid forget" has been renamed "grid remove",
          and "grid forget" now has semantics like "pack forget".
        <LI> The "grid" command no longer accepts floating-point values
          for row or column weights: integers must be used.
        </UL>

    <LI> There are new commands for creating common dialog boxes:
    tk_chooseColor, tk_getOpenFile, tk_getSaveFile and tk_messageBox.
    These use native dialog boxes if they are available.  Examples of
    the dialogs are available in the widget demo.

    <LI> There is a new virtual event mechanism for handling events in a
    more portable way.  See the new command "event".  It also allows
    events (both physical and virtual) to be generated dynamically.
    The Macintosh now generates <<Cut>>, <<Copy>>, <<Paste>>, and <<Clear>>
    events from the edit menu.        
</OL>

<P>  The only incompatible changes in this release are the last two for the
gridder ("grid forget" and integer row/column weights).  Most scripts
that ran under Tk 4.1 should also work under Tk 4.2 with no changes.

# MAILING LISTS

# Filter out mail from all mailing lists you are on =before= spam
# filtering.  I included two I subscribe to and recommend highly, but
# your list will doubtless be different.  Just duplicate the recipe
# for each mailing list you are on, and put the correct address for
# the list in the condition statement.  (The "* ^TO" part.)  If you
# read mail on shell, you may find it easier to deliver this mail
# to separate folders, especially for busy lists.  I do. :)

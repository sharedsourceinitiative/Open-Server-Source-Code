Ted is a text processor 
running under X Windows on Unix/Linux systems. <I>Ted</I> was developed 
as a standard easy word processor, having the role of <I>Wordpad</I> on 
MS-Windows, but more powerful. In our opinion, the possibility to type 
a letter or a note on a Unix/Linux machine is clearly missing. Only too 
often, you have to turn to a Windows machine to write a letter or an 
e-mail message. <I>Ted</I>s function is to be able to edit rich text 
documents on Unix/Linux in a <I>wysiwyg</I> way.
<P>
Compatibility with popular 
MS-Windows applications played an important role in the design of <I>Ted</I>. 
Every document produced by <I>Ted</I> should, without any loss of 
formatting or information, be accepted as a legal .rtf file by <I>Word</I>. 
Compatibility in the other direction is more difficult to achieve. <I>
Ted</I> supports most basic text formatting, as supported by the 
Microsoft applications. Other formatting instructions and meta 
information are ignored.*)  By ignoring unsupported formatting <I>Ted</I> 
tries to get the complete text of a document on screen. <I>Ted</I> can 
be used to read formatted e-mail sent from a Windows machine to Unix. 
Below we explain how to configure <I>Ted</I> as an RTF viewer in 
Netscape.
<P>
Most of the ignored 
information is not saved either when you modify and then save an RTF 
document with <I>Ted</I>.

<UL COMPACT><LI>Wysiwyg rich text editing. 
You can use all fonts for which you have a .afm file and that are 
available as an X11 font. <I>Ted</I> is delivered with .afm files for 
the Adobe fonts that are available on Motif systems and in all 
postscript printers: <FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Times</FONT>, 
Helvetica, <FONT FACE="Courier">Courier</FONT> and Symbol. Other fonts 
can be added with the normal X11 procedure. Font properties like bold 
and italic are supported; so is underlining.</LI>
<LI><I>Ted</I> uses Microsoft RTF 
as its native file format. Microsoft <I>Word</I> and <I>Wordpad </I>can 
read files produced by<I> Ted</I>. Usually <I>Ted</I> can read .rtf 
files from <I>Microsoft Word</I> and <I>Wordpad</I>. As <I>Ted</I> does 
not support all features of <I>Word,</I>some formatting information 
might be lost.</LI>

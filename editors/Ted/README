Ted is an easy rich text processor for X Windows
================================================

Introduction
------------

Ted can edit RTF files in a wysiwyg manner. It supports multiple fonts and
can print to PostScript printers.

The current version is 2.4.

More elaborate material is available through the web site:
http://www.de-does.demon.nl in particular in the readme.{html,rtf,txt}
files that make this concise README file obsolete.

You can try to download Ted from one of the following locations:
*   ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/editors/ted

Ready to Install Packages, Installation
---------------------------------------

Ready to install packages include general part: The program, afm files
and an American spelling checker. Additional packages with spell checkers
for different languages exist.

The following packages exist:
-   Ted_Linux_ix86.tar.gz:		The program, American spelling.
-   Ted_NL.tar.gz		Dutch spelling.
-   Ted_F.tar.gz		French spelling.
-   Ted_D.tar.gz		German spelling.
-   Ted_P.tar.gz		Portuguese spelling.
-   Ted_E.tar.gz		Spanish spelling.
-   Ted_GB.tar.gz		British spelling.

For more information in particular about configuration and issues around, 
X11 configuration, refer to the readme.rtf and readme.txt files.

Ted for Linux is free software. I assume no responsibility for the
consequences of using it. It is up to you to decide whether Ted suits
your purpose or not.

To install log in as root, change directory to the derectory for your
platform on the CD-ROM and issue the following command:
$ sh ./installTed.sh

If you do not trust my install script, you can install the different
packages manually. Unpack the *.tar.gz files with the following commands:
( As root )
$ umask 0
$ cd /usr/local
$ tar xvfz something.tar.gz

Source and Compilation
----------------------

Source is contained in the file ted-2.4.src.tar.gz

Ted relies on a Motif development environment, and on certain graphics
libraries.


*   Libtiff by Sam Leffler:
    ftp://sgi.com/graphics/tiff
*   Libjpeg by the independent JPEG group:
    ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg
    Version 6 is required. If you get undifened symbols like 'jpeg_std_error'
    you are using version 5.
*   Libpng by the PNG group:
    ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png
*   zlib by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler:
    ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib
*   Libgif by Gershon Elber and Eric S. Raymond:
    http://www.ccil.org/~esr/giflib

A free motif implementation is available from http://www.lesstif.org

To compile, simply call 'make', there is no need to call 'configure' as this
is done by make. To build an installation package, call 'make package' AS ROOT.

Ted can be installed from the package files that are produced in the
directory tedPackage in the root of the source tree. If you are planning
to actually distribute the package, it might be wise to link Ted
statically. With gcc this can be done with the -static flag on the link
command.

To install Ted, call 'make install' AS ROOT, or install the package as
described above.

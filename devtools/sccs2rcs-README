Sccs2rcs is a script to convert an existing SCCS
history into an RCS history without losing any of
the information contained therein.
It has been tested under the following OS's:
    SunOS 3.5, 4.0.3, 4.1
    Ultrix-32 2.0, 3.1

Things to note:
  + It will NOT delete or alter your ./SCCS history under any
circumstances.

  + Run in a directory where ./SCCS exists and where you can
      create ./RCS

  + /usr/local/bin is put in front of the default path.
    (SCCS under Ultrix is set-uid sccs, bad bad bad, so
    /usr/local/bin/sccs here fixes that)

  + Date, time, author, comments, branches, are all preserved.

  + If a command fails somewhere in the middle, it bombs with
    a message -- remove what it's done so far and try again.
        "rm -rf RCS; sccs unedit `sccs tell`; sccs clean"
    There is no recovery and exit is far from graceful.
    If a particular module is hanging you up, consider
    doing it separately; move it from the current area so that
    the next run will have a better chance or working.
    Also (for the brave only) you might consider hacking
    the s-file for simpler problems:  I've successfully changed
    the date of a delta to be in sync, then run "sccs admin -z"
    on the thing.

  + After everything finishes, ./SCCS will be moved to ./old-SCCS.

This file may be copied, processed, hacked, mutilated, and
even destroyed as long as you don't tell anyone you wrote it.
